# wordler
A short program I developed as a fun exercise in functional styles of programming. You can use it to play Wordle. 

If you want to use it make sure you have the wordles.txt file in the same directory and just type:

`
python3 wordler.py
`
Then just don't press "n" and enter in what you guessed followed by a 5 digit number which says how the game rated your answer.
For example, if you typed "burnt" and got 🟩⬛️⬛️🟨⬛️ then you should enter 20010.
